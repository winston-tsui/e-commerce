# E-Commerce Website

Winston Tsui's e-commerce application website intending to show more intermediate and advanced software engineering skills, using Next.js 13's app router. I manage **next.js** server actions and data intricacies with **Prisma ORM**. Authentication with **NextAuth.js** and **MongoDB**. UI using **TailwindCSS** and **DaisyUI**. Website deployment using **Vercel**. I use **Prettier** and **ESLint** for a streamlined development experience. Finally, I use **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**, **CSS** and **HTML**.

Notes: Fullstack project using next.js. Items are pre-rendered and cached, which makes page navigation fast. 
Next.js server actions are a way to execute POST requests on the server, such as adding an item to a cart. Anonymous and authenticated shopping cart merging feature. Pages are server side rendered, featuring faster load time and is great for SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

## Notes

Dependencies are in the `./package.json` file.

`npm i daisyui prisma @prisma/client next-auth @auth/prisma-adapter prettier eslint-config-prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss zod`
